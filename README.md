# Class Project 
Each member of the class was asked to "uncover" an 
overlooked site in Chicago, revealing an ongoing 
connection with the present day and with the past.

# Personal Reflection
It is so easy to go about life and overlook, or 
underthink, how we might be conceptualising our own
sense of identity and social relations. It is worthwhile 
to stop and question how things go to be the way they are. 
It's also worthwhile to stop and chat with people
who have been living or working in an area for decades. 
It may help to distinguish that which is of historical 
contingency versus that of deterministic inevitability.
